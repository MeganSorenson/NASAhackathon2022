Dance of Irradiance is an HTML5 game we designed for our challenge to creatively display data from the Parker Solar Probe. It uses the Phaser open source framework to make a Canvas and WebGL powered game that will run in a browser. 

In this game you will be helping our astronaut friend on a perilous mission near the surface of the sun!

| IMAGE 	| **Astronaut Friend:** Who is hiding behind that helmet? Is it me? Is it you? Is it AI? I guess we will never know... 	|
|-------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| iMAGE 	| **Fire:** The sun can get a little too hot for our astronaut friend at times. Avoid these at all costs.              	|
| IMage 	| **Space Trash:**                                                                                                     	|
